UAT files are stored in directory itc205asg4>test>UAT
There is one UAT file for each bug, each with two test scripts.
The first test script is to demonstrate the buggy behaviour. The second test script is to demonstrate the
bug has been fixed.

There are two test classes:
itc205asg4>test>hotel.checkout>TestBugOne.java
itc205asg4>test>hotel.service>TestBugTwo.java
These classes automate the buggy behaviour with the UI output shown in the console.

The debugging log file is located at:
itc205asg4>test>debug_log>itc205asg4_debuglog.txt

The before and after screenshots of the debugging process including variable values are located at:
itc205asg4>test>before_after>

There is an empty source folder called testfolder. This can be ignored.
